**PROJECT NAME:**

Reddit Data Engineering Pipeline

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ABSTRACT OF PROJECT:**

This project aims to provide a comprehensive data pipeline solution that extracts, transforms,
and loads (ETL) Reddit data into an Amazon Redshift data warehouse. Leveraging a combination of
tools and services such as Apache Airflow, Celery, PostgreSQL, Amazon S3, AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, 
and Amazon Redshift, this project demonstrates the creation and orchestration of an end-to-end 
data pipeline. The project includes tasks such as data extraction from the Reddit API, data 
transformation, data storage, and data warehousing, offering a scalable and efficient approach
to managing large volumes of social media data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE:**

The project addresses the challenge of efficiently collecting, processing, and analyzing large
volumes of Reddit data. By automating the ETL process, we aim to:

Simplify data extraction from the Reddit API.

Automate data transformation tasks to ensure data quality and consistency.

Provide a scalable solution for storing and querying large datasets using Amazon Redshift.

Enable organizations to gain insights from social media data through robust data warehousing
and analytics capabilities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**USE CASES WHICH CAN BENEFIT ON IMPLEMENTATION IN ORGANIZATIONS:**

Market Research and Sentiment Analysis:

Organizations can analyze Reddit discussions to understand public sentiment about their products,
services, or industry trends.

Customer Feedback and Support:
Businesses can monitor Reddit for customer feedback and support issues, enabling them to respond 
quickly and improve customer satisfaction.

Content Strategy and Engagement:
Marketing teams can identify popular topics and trends on Reddit to create engaging content and
drive social media strategy.

Product Development:
Insights from Reddit can inform product development by highlighting user needs, pain points,
and feature requests.

Competitor Analysis:
Organizations can track discussions about competitors to understand their strengths, 
weaknesses, and customer perceptions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**LIBRARIES USED AND WHY:**

Apache Airflow:

Reason: To orchestrate and schedule the ETL workflow, ensuring tasks are executed in the correct order and at the right time.

Pandas:

Reason: For data manipulation and analysis, providing powerful tools to clean, transform, and analyze the data extracted from Reddit.

PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper):

Reason: To extract data from Reddit, including posts, comments, and user interactions, simplifying the process of interacting with the Reddit API.

NumPy:

Reason: To perform numerical operations and handle large multi-dimensional arrays, supporting
efficient data processing and transformation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TECHNOLOGY USED AND WHY:**

AWS S3:

Reason: To store raw and processed data, providing a scalable and cost-effective storage solution.

AWS Glue:

Reason: For further data transformation and manipulation, enabling efficient ETL processes and 
integration with other AWS services.

AWS Athena:
Reason: To query data stored in S3 using SQL, providing an easy and serverless way to 
analyze large datasets.

Amazon Redshift:

Reason: As the data warehouse solution, offering scalable storage and high-performance querying
capabilities for large datasets.

Apache Airflow:

Reason: For orchestrating the ETL workflow, ensuring tasks are executed in the correct order
and at the right time.

Celery:

Reason: For distributed task execution and handling asynchronous tasks, providing scalability
and reliability to the pipeline.

PostgreSQL:

Reason: Used as the metadata database for Apache Airflow, storing information about the DAGs 
and their execution states.

Docker:
Reason: To containerize the applications and dependencies, ensuring consistency across different 
environments and simplifying deployment.

**Future Scope of Work:**

As a potential future scope , an integration of the a reporting tool like Tableau/Power BI will
be done , where we can track in realtime the data statistics in a graphical way using charts. 
This will end the end client/stakeholder to have an understandingof the system without delving
deep into the tech side. Hence can take logical decisions based on the graphical view / mapping 
of the system in place



Integrating Tableau with the project can provide significant benefits for clients and stakeholders
by transforming raw data into actionable insights through interactive dashboards and visualizations. 
Here’s how Tableau can be leveraged:

Interactive Dashboards:

Create dynamic and interactive dashboards that allow clients to explore the analysis of Reddit data
in real-time. Users can drill down into specific details and filter data based on various parameters 
such as subreddit, keywords, or time range.

Real-time Data Visualization:

Connect Tableau directly to the data stored in Amazon Redshift to visualize real-time data streaming
into the system. This enables stakeholders to monitor live updates and trends as new Reddit posts and 
comments are processed.

Sentiment Trends Analysis:

Visualize sentiment trends over time to identify patterns and shifts in public opinion on Reddit. 
This can help businesses understand the impact of their actions on user sentiment and make timely adjustments.

Geospatial Analysis:

Use Tableau’s mapping capabilities to visualize the geographical distribution of Reddit users and their
sentiments. This can help identify regional trends and preferences.

Performance Metrics:

Track key performance metrics such as the volume of posts processed, sentiment scores, and response times. 
This can provide insights into the efficiency of the data pipeline and the overall health of the system.

Customizable Reports:

Generate customizable reports that can be shared with different departments within the organization. 
These reports can include insights tailored to the specific needs of marketing, customer service, product development, 
and other teams.

Alerting and Notifications:

Set up alerts and notifications within Tableau to inform stakeholders about significant changes in sentiment or 
other important metrics. This ensures that key decision-makers are always aware of critical insights as they happen.
