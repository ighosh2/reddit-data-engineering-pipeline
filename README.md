**PROJECT NAME:**
Reddit Data Engineering Pipeline

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ABSTRACT OF PROJECT:**

This project aims to provide a comprehensive data pipeline solution that extracts, transforms,
and loads (ETL) Reddit data into an Amazon Redshift data warehouse. Leveraging a combination of
tools and services such as Apache Airflow, Celery, PostgreSQL, Amazon S3, AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, 
and Amazon Redshift, this project demonstrates the creation and orchestration of an end-to-end 
data pipeline. The project includes tasks such as data extraction from the Reddit API, data 
transformation, data storage, and data warehousing, offering a scalable and efficient approach
to managing large volumes of social media data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE:
The project addresses the challenge of efficiently collecting, processing, and analyzing large volumes of Reddit data. By automating the ETL process, we aim to:

Simplify data extraction from the Reddit API.
Automate data transformation tasks to ensure data quality and consistency.
Provide a scalable solution for storing and querying large datasets using Amazon Redshift.
Enable organizations to gain insights from social media data through robust data warehousing and analytics capabilities.
USE CASES WHICH CAN BENEFIT ON IMPLEMENTATION IN ORGANIZATIONS:

Market Research and Sentiment Analysis:
Organizations can analyze Reddit discussions to understand public sentiment about their products, services, or industry trends.

Customer Feedback and Support:
Businesses can monitor Reddit for customer feedback and support issues, enabling them to respond quickly and improve customer satisfaction.

Content Strategy and Engagement:
Marketing teams can identify popular topics and trends on Reddit to create engaging content and drive social media strategy.

Product Development:
Insights from Reddit can inform product development by highlighting user needs, pain points, and feature requests.

Competitor Analysis:
Organizations can track discussions about competitors to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and customer perceptions.

LIBRARIES USED AND WHY:

Reddit API:

Reason: To extract data from Reddit, including posts, comments, and user interactions.
Apache Airflow:

Reason: To orchestrate and schedule the ETL workflow, ensuring tasks are executed in the correct order and at the right time.
Celery:

Reason: For distributed task execution and handling asynchronous tasks, providing scalability and reliability to the pipeline.
PostgreSQL:

Reason: Used as the metadata database for Apache Airflow, storing information about the DAGs and their execution states.
Docker:

Reason: To containerize the applications and dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying deployment.
TECHNOLOGY USED AND WHY:

AWS S3:
Reason: To store raw and processed data, providing a scalable and cost-effective storage solution.
AWS Glue:
Reason: For further data transformation and manipulation, enabling efficient ETL processes and integration with other AWS services.
AWS Athena:
Reason: To query data stored in S3 using SQL, providing an easy and serverless way to analyze large datasets.
Amazon Redshift:
Reason: As the data warehouse solution, offering scalable storage and high-performance querying capabilities for large datasets.
By implementing this project, organizations can streamline their data engineering workflows, enhance their ability to derive insights from Reddit data, and leverage cloud technologies for scalable and efficient data processing.
